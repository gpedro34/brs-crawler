# TODO
- Implement getMiningInfo API call to retrieve generationSignature (to enable forks tracking) - save last 10 blocks to db would be great
- JSON validation of data received by nodes
- Historic tracking
- Uptime calculations incl. rotation/compression of old historic data
- Locate nodes based on IP (Country + City)
- Check if a wallet is public (try to reach port 8125 - a boolean is enough in DB)
- If wallet is public then do SSL confirmation (save if it has cert and if it is valid - 2 booleans are enough in DB)
- Public API service serving data from shared database
- Frontend/UI using data from public API
- Unit Testing
- ...?
